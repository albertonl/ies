## Text content

I was a little kid at elementary school when, one day, I called 'mom' my teacher. That moment was very embarrassing for me, just as it would have been for nearly every other kid. One of my theories about why did I say that is that my actual mother was working in the same school at that time, and, maybe having had seen her during the break, I might have got confused.

Returning to the actual moment, I remember that the entirety of my classmates burst out laughing, even the teacher. Instead, my face turned red as a tomato. I was thinking 'Earth, please swallow me up right now'. During the first moments I thought I would be marked forever as 'the teacher's kid', but that was indeed not true. Fast forward to five minutes later, everyone forgot about it, and the class got back to normal. Finally I was able to untie the knot in my throat.
