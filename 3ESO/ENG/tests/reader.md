## 1. Where and when does the story take place

The story of _The Tattooist of Auschwitz_ takes place almost entirely in the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, near the cities of Katowice and Krakow, in Southern Poland, during the Second World War, more precisely between 1942 and 1945.

## 2. Write what the story is about

This story is essentially a historical novel, that explains the horrific story of the Holocaust, the prosecution and murder of millions of Jews all around the nations controlled by the Nazis. However, the actual topic is a love story in such a hostile environment as Auschwitz was.

## 3. Who are the main characters

Although this story is very complex, and the amount of characters is numerous, there are essentially two characters of special importance for the evolution of the plot. These characters are Lale Eisenberg (the absolute main character, being the tattooist of the Auschwitz concentration camp for the Jewish newcomers), and Gita Furman.

## 4. What is the relationship to one another (among the main characters)

Firstly, it is necessary to know that neither Lale nor Gita knew each other before getting brought to the camp, although they both came from the same country, Slovakia. This means that all of their bonds were created during their nearly 3-year stay in the camp. Basically, the only significant bond between them is their mutual, passionate love, that would later be converted into a happy and long marriage.

## 5. Who were the minor characters and what are their roles

Likewise for determining who the main characters are, the big amount of characters also applies when defining the minor (or second-degree) characters. I will be covering these 'second-degree' characters, due to the fact that other 'third-degree' characters do not have a representative enough role in the story. In this case, we would have 7 minor characters:

- Baretski: he is the guard (SS officer) in charge of Lale.

- Leon: the first man whose arm Lale tattooed, and also his faithful assistant and friend.

- Dana and Ivana: two of Gita's friends. They have a decisive role keeping Gita alive when she contracted typhus, and supporting each other.

- Cilka: another of Gita's friends and also her co-worker. She is described in the story as 'the plaything of Schwarzhuber', referring to Johann Schwarzhuber, an SS senior officer.

- Jakub: a strong Jew that Lale decided to help giving him some food, as he needed it more than the rest. This action made Lale stay alive after being punished and tortured in the Punishment Block.

- Nadya: an elder Gypsy woman staying in Lale's block, with whom Lale creates a very affective friendship bond.

## 6. Describe an important scene from the story

Scared because of the imminent arrival of the Russians, the panicked SS decide to empty the camp. One night, they empty the women's blocks. Lale gets awaken by the noise, and goes outside to see what is happening. Nervous, and sure that Gita, his love, was somewhere between the endless lines of women, goes up and down the rows trying to find her. Eventually, when the gates are wide open and the women start to walk outside, he sees her. 'Gita!' he screams. He gets stopped by an SS officer when trying to reach her. After trying a couple more times, she sees him, and says 'Furman! My name is Gita Furman!' This is because she did not want to tell Lale what her full name was until they left the camp alive.

## 7. How did you feel about the story and characters

Honestly, having read more books about the Holocaust, at first I thought this story was not going to be anything better than what I had already seen. But I was completely wrong. I personally think that the combination of history and love in a novel based on real events, is perfect. The perfectly defined plot and characters, that due to the story's complexity, it is even more difficult for the writer, are emotional in a way that you might release a few tears, but they are so enjoyable, that you cannot take the book down.

## 8. Summary of the book

Lale Eisenberg is a Slovakian Jew who is brought to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp for hard work. Thanks to his good behavior, he gets offered a job as a tattooist for the newcomers. His job is to tattoo the identification numbers of the new Jews being brought everyday. One day, while tattooing a group of women, he has in front of himself the most beautiful girl he has ever seen, who he later finds out is called Gita. After some letters and a couple meetups, they fall in love, and encourage each other to gain force to stay alive in this place of death. Thanks to Lale's privileged position among the prisoners, he finds a way to smuggle food into the camp to share with other prisoners, which makes it a little easier to subsist. After practicing these irregularities for around a year, and sharing with all the prisoners he can reach, even the Gypsy newcomers that occupy his block, to which he becomes a great friend; one day the SS discover this. As punishment, he gets brought for an entire month into the Penal Unit, or the Punishment Block, where he gets tortured. Almost sure that he is not going to make it alive, he thinks of how his life would be if Gita and him were living a peaceful life together. Eventually, he gets unknowingly released from the Penal Unit, and after a couple weeks of extreme hard work, he gets his job as a tattooist back. Fast forward in time to when the Russians are advancing quickly into Poland, the Nazis decide to empty the camp. Gita manages to escape with a group of Polish girls and makes it back to Bratislava. Lale, a little more unfortunate, has to stay longer in a German concentration camp, from where he's able to escape, and after working for around a month for the Russians, he also manages to escape and make it back to Bratislava, where they reencounter.
