## Summary

Frank Scudder is chased by German spies so he stops at Hannay's flat and asks him for help, since he needs a place to hide. Scudder tells Hannay they're running after him because he knows about their plan to murder the Greek Prime Minister, Karolides, who is coming to London on June 15th. Hannay lets Scudder hide in his flat for several days and Scudder warns him about two dangerous German spies. Scudder asks Hannay to continue the fight if something happens to him. The following day, Hannay finds Scudder dead.

Hannay then decides to continue Scudder's work, but he needs to run away to Scotland before Scudder's enemies catch him. So he leaves his flat dressed up as a milkman. He then gets on a train to Galloway taking with him Scudder's little book.

During the trip to Galloway, he reads Scudder's notes and discovers that he used a special code. The next day, on a train to Dumfries, he reads the newspaper and finds out that the London police have discovered Scudder's body and that they were looking for him, so he decides to get off the train. Hannay runs towards the river and up the hills and sees a plane flying around the place. He realizes that the German spies are after him. He walks until he reaches an hotel. The young owner is a writer, so he decides to tell him his story but asks him not to do anything before June 15th. The German spies come to the hotel looking for Hannay, but he manages to escape.

He then drives away as fast as possible in a stolen car. Now that he has learned how to read Scudder's code, he knows that the Germans are planning to kill Karolides to have an excuse to start the war. The words "thirty-nine steps" are everywhere in Scudder's notebook but he does not understand what they mean. He realizes that the local police and the German plane are chasing him so he jumps out of the car and lets it fall into a river. Hannay is lucky to be helped by a young man, Sir Harry, who happens to be the nephew of the Foreign Office Secretary, so Hannay tells him his story. Sir Harry decides to help Hannay by sending a letter to his uncle to schedule a meeting with him before June 15th.

The German plane is still chasing Hannay, so he hides for the night. He meets a roadman, Turnbull, and takes his place after changing clothes with him. Hannay takes over Turnbull's work. The German spies who previously followed him to the young man's hotel see him and interrogate him but they don't notice who he is. Then Hannay runs into Jopley, a man he knew, and they both escape in Jopley's car.

Hannay, still disguised as Turnbull, finds that several policemen are searching for him, so he decides to escape across the countryside. Hannay reaches an old man's house and the man tells him to hide inside. Soon Hannay realizes the old man is Scudder's worst enemy. The old man knows who Hannay really is and he ignores his lies and stories. He is then locked up in a room where he finds dynamite. He blows up one of the walls and manages to run out of the house and hide on top of a nearby tower.

The day after, he goes back to the ground, and walks all the way to Turnbull's cottage to look for Scudder's notebook. He takes a train back to London but gets off to meet the Foreign Office Secretary, Sir Walter. Hannay tells Sir Walter about the German plot, Scudder's secret code and his own story. Sir Walter tells Hannay that he knows who he really is and that the police are not looking for him anymore. Hannay and Sir Walter work on Scudder's code and they are shocked to hear that Karolides has been killed.

Sir Walter tells Hannay that he suspects that there is a German spy in the Foreign Office or in the War Office. Both men go to Scotland Yard. The police tells Hannay he is a free man. But when Hannay leaves, he has a bad feeling and goes back to Sir Walter's house. There he runs into the First Lord, a man he has never seen before and yet looks familiar. He soon realizes that the man is part of the Black Stone disguised as Lord Alloa.

The other top politicians and military men present in the meeting, along with Sir Walter, are shocked by the news about the Black Stone. They now have to change their plans since the Black Stone group knows everything about them. All the men realize that they have to prevent the German spies by leaving England by ship. Suddenly, Hannay remembers Scudder's notes about the tides and the 'thirty-nine steps'. The men discover that Scudder's code refers to a place in Kent and they all agree that the search operation should be in Hannay's hands.

Once in Kent, Hannay and his men go to the place known as the Ruff and find the house they were looking for, Trafalgar Lodge. Hannay sees three men in the house who look like British men but, he suspects, are in fact the three German spies. Hannay enters the house ready to arrest the men but they pretend not to be the spies. The three men try to escape but Hannay finally manages to catch them and send them to prison.

## Opinion

To me, this book feels like it was written last year, but it's a great surprise to discover that the original version was first published back in 1915! The plot is very interesting and holds your attention all the way through.

To be honest, I find it completely worth reading, though I feel like it's missing something if compared to at least other reviews from the original version. Otherwise fully recommended.
