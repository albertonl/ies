## Summary

_Pride and Prejudice_ follows the Bennet family, where Mrs. Bennet is anxious to see her five daughters all married and living happily, especially because all of the family estate is to be inherited by Mr. Bennet's cousin, Mr. Collins, due to him being male.

At a ball, the wealthy and newly arrived Mr. Bingley takes interest in Jane, the eldest Bennet daughter. Meanwhile, the encounter between her sister Elizabeth and his friend Darcy is less cordial.

Mr. Collins subsequently arrives, hoping to marry one of the Bennet sisters. Nevertheless, Elizabeth refuses his proposal, and then he becomes husband of her friend Charlotte. Not long afterwards, Elizabeth finds Mr. Wickham, a charming military officer, and they both show a mutual interest in each other, and then he accuses Darcy (as to be seen later, this being a false accusation) of denying his inheritance from Darcy's father, existent because his father showed a great interest in the little Wickham.

After Mr. Bingley's abrupt departure for London, Elizabeth's dislike of Darcy increases when she becomes convinced about him discouraging Bingley's relationship with Jane. Darcy, on the other hand, has grown increasingly fond of Elizabeth, admiring her intelligence and vitality.

While visiting the newly married Charlotte, Elizabeth encounters Darcy, who professes his love for her and proposes her marriage. Elizabeth, surprised, refuses his offer, and when Darcy demands an explanation, she accuses him of breaking up Jane and Bingley, and also wrongly accuses him based on the accusation to Darcy that Mr. Wickham shared with her.

The day after, Elizabeth receives a letter from him, hand to hand, in which he explains that he separated the couple along with Mr. Bingley's sister because he did not believe Jane returned Bingley's affection. He also discloses that Wickham's accusations are completely false, and after explaining Wickham's story, he says Wickham tried to marry Darcy's sister in an attempt to gain possession of her large fortune. With these revelations, Elizabeth starts to see in Darcy a new light.

Shortly thereafter, the youngest Bennet sister, Lydia, escapes towards the North of England along with Wickham. These news are met with great alarm by Elizabeth, since the scandalous affair, which is likely to end in marriage, could ruin the reputation of the Bennet's family. Eventually, they marry.

Later on, at the encouragement of Darcy, Mr. Bingley returns to town, and he and Jane become engaged. Darcy proposes again to Elizabeth, who this time accepts.

## Opinion

I found this book a whole lot more interesting than I could have ever imagined. After doing some tasks around this work by Jane Austen, I gained a big interest on this book, and I wanted to give it a shot.

However, I had a stereotypical opinion of the story, and it is, indeed, stereotypical to some extent, but this is a normal thing among the works published around this time. But this is not a normal stereotypical story. In fact, presents a different prospective of the classic topics (love, jealousy, honor...), which is, at the same time, brilliant, and gets me hooked to reading it, and that is why I loved the story, and would want to come back and reread the complete original version.
